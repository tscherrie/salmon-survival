// Everything a fish does about food is measured against its own body rather than the

// amplitude and 242 ms at threshold (Bleckmann 1980, doi:10.1007/BF00606308). What it

// surface specialists that was measured on, so the splash is a direction to look in and
// nothing more, and how wrong that direction is has never been measured. Sight gives a

// radius every fish crosses on the same frame. Smell is last and worst: the plume only
// goes where the water goes, so a fish downstream meets it ten or twenty seconds late

// A fish that has found food is a far louder signal than a 1 mm pellet: it accelerates,

// than all-or-nothing, because it is appetite and not reflex. A recruit aims at the fish

// closes the last body length slowly and deliberately -- and the slow part is not
// timidity. A 1 mm pellet has no inertia worth the name and is pushed by the water the
// fish itself is shoving ahead of it, a field that is self-similar in approach speed and
// gone by about a body length ahead (Stewart et al. 2014, doi:10.1242/jeb.111773), so a
